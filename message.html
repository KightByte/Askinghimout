            Hey baby, I had so much fun with you today. It's amazing how much brighter my life feels now that you're in it again. I hope that in time you will be able to repeat that sentiment yourself baby. I love you so much and you of all people know that I'm not afraid to be cringey or corny about it. I love you to your fullest and I feel that so pure it can't be denied. The need to thank you crosses my mind often, yaknow. To thank you for giving me a sweet voice to excitedly wake up to every morning. Thank you for the feeling of joy you make me feel when we laugh and soak in each other's company on games or in movies. Thank you for sharing my stupid nerdy interests enough for me to yap about comics, anime, cars, code, anything. But I suppose those are all really the same statement. Thank you for loving me James. I will do whatever it takes on this horrid earth to pay back the debt my heart owes you.

            I mean hell, I built this whole website just so that I could ask you out and finally have you tied down. To be honest I needed to get that done before you got to college and got some joe shmoe ass bf. But still, I wanted to use this website for a little more than just a small throwaway gift. So I decided to port our daily paragraphs to the website for you to check daily. This will allow a lot more creativity with the paragraphs so I can make you so many cooler things! when I get the ideas for em :(.

            Today is sadly the 2nd day of school, so a good bit of our morning will be stripped from us. I hate it just as much as you do baby I promise. But dad has to work super hard at his school so he can come and live with his little baby and go to school together with him &lt;3.
