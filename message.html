       GOOD MORNING BABY!
<br><br>
        Ive missed you so much, and Ive been thinking of you even more than that. Normally for these paragraphs Ill have some sort of topic or theme to help make things flow smoothly. Usually with some well thought out poetic lines. Today Im throwing that standard out of the window. I want to be as genuine with you as I can be. Im writing this as I think of it with no backspacing or holding back. Just my pure honest feelings with no structure. So Im sorry if I get emo
<br><br>
        I dont just love you James. The feeling is something far more, something far deeper than the word love can describe it to be. There is a constant hunger in my soul that only you can satisfy. This feeling eats at me every time we talk, it yells at me. "Tell him you love him" it screams as you blissfully enjoy yourself in the cutest ways, "Tell him that youll miss him" it screams as you leave, even if only for a moment. It feels like my heart has hacked into my brain and taken control. Around you I am not capable of high thought, all power is diverted straight to my love for you. But I have no complaints, my feelings my trump logic but they are on the same side here. We are perfect for eachother. We both stride to live lives that connect like puzzle pieces. We love the idea of moving to New Zealand, so we can go and live together. We love the same house designs, so you can design and I can build it all. We Love the same media, so no movie or show played will be watched alone. We love eachother, the way our eyes meet prove this beyond a doubt. My heart, my brain, and my soul all yearn to be with you. I pray every night to gods I dont even believe in, just so I can assure myself that you love me the same. We can be so happy together baby
<br><br>
        The only downside to this hunger is that there is no way to express it fully. I often find myself looking into your camera saying things that come from deep within my heart. But when they leave my tongue all that comes out are basic sentances anyone could say. I watch you say your thanks as I cringe to myself, feeling as if I have no mouth to voice my overwhelming feelings for you. I am no poet who knows how to envoke every emotion with thte right set of words, I am no god that is all powerful and could bema pure understanding into you, I am not even close to these ideals of man. And it burns me inside to know that no matter how much I yell from the pits of my soul that you will never be able to fully grasp how fully I mean the words that I say to you. They just dont translate.
<br><br>
        When I told you today as you applied your makeup was so simple. "You look so pretty" and you smiled and thanked me for it. But it meant more, it always does. It means that looking into your eyes stuns me. They pierce right through my barriers and straight into my heart with love. The way you move your pretty lips as you talk holds me captive, lost in every word you say enjoying the sounds more as music than conversation. The beautiful hair you play with so effortlessly... just... even as I write this it feels like all I can say isnt enough. This pitiful earthly language limits me so much I am isolated from having your heart fully grasp mine. I love you, I love you so fucking much
