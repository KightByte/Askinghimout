        GOOD MORNING BABY!!! Im sure today for you will already be filled to the brim as it is so I wont take up too much of your morning with this.
<br><br>
        Big day today isnt it, getting to see you get into the college you like for the career you love, its amazing after all these years of hearing you talk about it. I know that things have been weird for us these past couple of months, but we should put that aside to genuinly give you the praise you deserve for such a feat. If you choose to admit it or not you worked your ass off for this. You put the stress and effort in to make your dream actually come true. And I dont think I have given you the praise you deserve for that. Theres no doubt that things between us have been... off lately. But lets not forget that we are partners of 2 1/2 years. Seeing the boy I met at 15 grow up to do exactly what he wanted, not grow up.
<br><br>
        You mention the fear of having to grow up often. That you wish you could be a 13 year old forever. And in truth thats where your life is heading now, all thanks to you. "Pick a job you love, and youll never work a day in your life." You will get to go to clock in every day with a smile on your face because you earned the job you love. You wont be stuck in a boring 9-5 or some art degree job, no youre above that. You are a dman marine biologist. You get to play with fish as a profession, and you can do that for the rest of your life baby. I hope to whatever god may exist that I am blessed enough to see you graduate.
<br><br>
        I said I wouldnt take your whole day so I promise I wont, Im just... Im so fucking proud of you. I know that holds no meaning to you anymore, my approval. But I truely am so happy to see you achieve this, you deserve it so much. I will go to bed knowing that my boyfriend is amazing. Goodnight now baby, I love you.
