        Good morning sweetie. I decided to freshen up this page to be a bit nicer on your pretty eyes. Took me an hour to manage to make it fit to screen im ngl Im so sleepy ðŸ’€. I hope you enjoy getting to see your litle brat on the site every morning when you check in, let me know if you want anything else added too okay?
  <br><br>
        before I go I wanted to let you know that I really enjoy getting to see your webcam as we call, not getting to see your face while we talk has been something I have missed for a long time. Youre very pretty so keep doing it please. I don't know if you are interested in seeing my face as we call but if you are I will be showering tomorrow morning so the excuse of being greasy will be gone. So up to you if you want me to join you. Anyway my point is that it really brings a smile to my face to get to see yours as you do simple things like play games with me or scroll pinterest. I love you sm baby.
  <br><br>
        Goodnight now Ba, please rest easy for me like the baby you are. I will have my alarms set for 7:30 and 8:00 which are now alot louder so dont worry about me sleeping in okay love? mmmmmwah, goodnight~<3
