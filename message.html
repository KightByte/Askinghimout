        GOOD MORNING BABY!!!. Ive missed you from the moment you left love.
<br><br>
        Hopefully the night treated you as good as a princess like you deserves. Sadly I'm not to confident in that fact today as when I came to my computer to write you this I opened our chats and saw that I had two missed calls from you in the night. My heart sank and I imedietly called you back not realising that I was far too late. I don't know why but sometime in the night you missed me and I... wasnt there. You mustve felt so alone having to go back to bed like that, that image breaks my heart. I am so fucking sorry baby. I promise that I will always be there for you and tonight was not reflective of that. I know that this probably isnt a big deal for you but its destroying mine. Im sorry if im taking this too serious
