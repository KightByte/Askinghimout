        GOOD MORNING BABY!!!. Ive missed you from the moment you left love.
<br><br>
        Hopefully the night treated you as good as a princess like you deserves. Sadly I'm not to confident in that fact today as when I came to my computer to write you this I opened our chats and saw that I had two missed calls from you in the night. My heart sank and I imedietly called you back not realising that I was far too late. I don't know why but sometime in the night you missed me and I... wasnt there. You mustve felt so alone having to go back to bed like that, that image breaks my heart. I am so fucking sorry baby. I promise that I will always be there for you and tonight was not reflective of that. I know that this probably isnt a big deal for you but its destroying mine. Im so deeply sorry James you have no idea how much shame this brings me. Im sorry if im taking this too serious aswell
<br><br>
        Now outside of that I do actually have alot to talk about. I wont spout it all here as I now have to wake up incredibly early for a chance to check in with you as soon as possible so some will be saved to tell you face to face.
<br><br>
        Firstly is a simple thank you. Thank you for taking me back. I know that everything you said when you ended things was genuine, I know that youre far out of my league, and I know that you dont see what you want in me. Although it breaks my heart I do not see what you said as harmful, its tough love. Yes you were angry, yes you yelled. But I know that it didnt come from pure hate, it came from need. You love me too, but you need me to be 100% of myself for you. And I understand. Ive spent most of my day thinking of that and the list of requirements that you gave me and I've come to the best conclusion that I can. Yes I can. I am capable of being everything you listed, I am capable of loving you, I am capable of making you happier. But that is where my issue lies, having the means but never doing. Im sick of that, sick of being too late. Change starts today and I mean that as litterally as you can imagine it. Starting tomorrow im not going to be a fucking tweaker anymore. Not the day afterm not promises of someday In the future, tomorrow. So if you notice any changes in me or new things I may begin to talk about please understand. I promised you I would do whatever it takes to keep you, even if that means learning to love myself too.
<br><br>
        Secondly I wanted to just give you the reminder of my most common phrase. "I love you". Know that It still rings true no matter how many times I repeat it. Those 3 words come from my soul every time they are spoken. They come from the part of me that no one else is allowed into. A part of me that is so vast and full of yearning for you. I love you. I love your looks. I love your patience. I love the way you sound when youre half-awake. I love the way you view the world. I love your simple mind/ I love when you notice beauty in ways I could never have thought of. I love all of you fully. Its no secret that I do either, I know you know its true. 
<br><br>
        And it looks like the rest will have to wait for tomorrow, I cant be up any later or I will sleep through my alarm honey, I hope you can understand. I promise that I love you in ways that you can never imagine. And hopefully I will wake up before you do so I can check in. Goodnight baby, Lets have an amazing day tomorrow, together.
