        Hey babe, I hope you had a peaceful night of rest. To be honest im running out of unique ways to say goodmorning ðŸ˜­. Today I wanted to highlight something that has become very important to me, the time we share.
<br><br>
        I love that we're getting into old habbits again. the time we spend playing fortnite together is so much fun. The time slipped by so fast I hadnt noticed 1 hour turned into 4 1/2. And with pinterest we could just loose hours enjoying the vintage house ideas and little ladybug fruits. Same with Hunter X Hunter too, its so nice to just sit down and enjoy a story alongside you. I cant wait to see where the Chimera Ant ark goes, but also Im worried that Killua bled tf out off-screen LOL. We need to get into more old stuff we used to, I would love to maybe even start some new stuff like Supernatural or some games we've been interested in. But it would be nice to re-play stuff like Palworld, Stardew, PEAK, Steins Gate, and Danganrompa before you leave for school? Spending time together like that is special and I want to cherish it with you. That said I am getting addicted to fn with you so I wont say no to playing that too heh.
<br></br>
        Enough about media though, I want to talk about you. These moments arent memorable to me because of the content I consumed. They matter because of who I got to share it with, you. Nothing in the world feels better than when I'm having fun and hear your little laugh on the other side of the screen knowing that youre enjoying spending that with me. Sharing our jokes back and fourth making each one better than the last. Stupid conversations that devolve into nothing as we just enjoy the time passing togehter. Enjoy living in eachothers company. It feels like an embrace, like despite our distance we are still able to hold onto one another. That means something to me, and I hope it does for you too baby. Its beautiful.
