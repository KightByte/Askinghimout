       GOOD MORNING BABY!
<br><br>
        Ive missed you so much, and Ive been thinking of you even more than that. Normally for these paragraphs Ill have some sort of topic or theme to help make things flow smoothly. Usually with some well thought out poetic lines. Today Im throwing that standard out of the window. I want to be as genuine with you as I can be. Im writing this as I think of it with no backspacing or holding back. Just my pure honest feelings with no structure.
<br><br>
        I dont just love you James. The feeling is something far more, something far deeper than the word love can describe it to be. There is a constant hunger in my soul that only you can satisfy. This feeling eats at me every time we talk, it yells at me. "Tell him you love him" it screams as you blissfully enjoy yourself in the cutest ways, "Tell him that youll miss him" it screams as you leave, even if only for a moment. It feels like my heart has hacked into my brain and taken control. Around you I am not capable of high thought, all power is diverted straight to my love for you. But I have no complaints, my feelings my trump logic but they are on the same side here. We are perfect for eachother. We both stride to live lives that connect like puzzle pieces. We love the idea of moving to New Zealand, so we can go and live together. We love the same house designs, so you can design and I can build it all. We Love the same media, so no movie or show played will be watched alone. We love eachother, the way our eyes meet prove this beyond a doubt. My heart, my brain, and my soul all yearn to be with you. I pray every night to gods I dont even believe in, just so I can assure myself that you love me the same. We can be so happy together baby
