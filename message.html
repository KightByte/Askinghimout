Hey baby Im happy to see you came back to check the website for this paragraph. I want to start with an apology for my behavior last night. I asked you to show parts of your body that you clearly were not comfortable with. I should have known and enforced your boundaries and Im sorry that I failed to do so. I promise to show more consideration for your body and comfort in the future.
<br><br>
Youve only been gone for an hour now and it feels like an eternity yaknow. Today was just as beautiful as the other days i have been blessed with this past week. I never feel like I tell you that I love you enough even when its all i say these days. That isnt because my words have no meaning, its because Im not using the right ones. When I say "I love you" it means a million different things.
<br><br>
It means that any insecurity you have hold no power to me. You are perfect in every way. Not too big in any area, nor too small in another. Not an ugly cell on your body, nor a bad part of your beautiful mind. You are the best person I can dream of.
<br><br>
It means that when I am not busy I will always think of you. Think of the ways you make me smile, the ways you make me laugh. Remember times that have long since passed but will always hold a place in my heart.
<br><br>
It means that there is nothing in this world that I would not personally do for you. Not a dime I wouldnt spend, not a second I wouldnt share. There is no mountain high enough, nor a vally low enough to keep me from getting to you baby.
<br><br>
It means that I pay attention to the little details and hints in your daily life. Picking up on how you feel or what you might want to feel better is always my top priority. Making sure that all your needs are met at all times so you can be happy.
<br><br>
It means that you care cared for no matter where you are. No matter how horrible you feel in any given moment you should always know that somewhere out there in the far south of oklahoma, there is a man who loves you unconditionally
<br><br>
It means all of this and more. So when you hear me say those words youve heard a billion times a day, remember that means that all of this applies a billion times over. 
<br><br>
I hope that right now you are sleeping as peaceful as the baby kitty you are darling. Youre so adorable when youre getting some nice proper rest, so cute with that little yawn when you wake up too. Too bad Im not there to see my princess wake up. Soon I will be. Because I really am serious about making this relationship work, even if that means trying to make this college visit happen. If I can come see you again and give you the physical love you crave, you would be so much happier. I know that there will be hard times from our past that make it hard to see through to the end of this. I know that not every day will be perfect and there will be times we need each other more than ever coming over the horizon. But I also know that there is a paragraph pinned in our discord dms that you wrote, and it spoke to me. It assured the path of becoming the adults society expects us to be, but to face it together as a team. Allowing ourselves to be the highschool sweethearts we have always craved. I know that we have what it takes to grow old together. our humor, interests, hobbies, media, music, life goals, family, everything. Its all within us baby. And I see it in you every day.
<br><br>
I love you so much James please get the best sleep in the world for me tonight, and I cant wait to see you tomorrow. goodnight sweetie, mmmmmmwah ❤️
